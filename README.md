# ITSkillDashboard

This is a single page template design  and it is also a collaborative project. We made use of HTML,CSS, javascript and Chart.js in this project.
we were unable to complete this project because we worked collaboratively using github on the same html page. The challenge came from 
indiviadual collaborators Vanila CSS interfering with
another collaborators design on the same page.
I found out that with Tailwind CSS the challenge we experienced woud likely not happen because taillwind css only permits
you to style directly into the HTML elements.
This will ensure individual collaborators styling applies only to the element that was directy styled using tailwind atomic classes.
Also since we are using Tailwind atomic classes to style, we are sure of using a well defind class that is writing
and reviewd by group of professionals around the world.
