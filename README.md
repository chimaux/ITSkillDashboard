# ITSkillDashboard suspended/uncompleted

This is a single page template design  and it is also a collaborative project. We used HTML,CSS, javascript and Chart.js in this project.
We were unable to complete this project because we worked collaboratively using github on the same html page. The challenge came from 
indiviadual collaborators Vanila CSS interfering with
another collaborators CSS classes on the same page.
I found out that with Tailwind CSS the challenge we experienced would likely not happen because taillwind css only permits
you to style directly into the HTML elements.
This will ensure individual collaborators styling applies only to the element that was directy styled using tailwind atomic classes.
Also since we are using Tailwind atomic classes to style, we are sure of using a well defined class that is written
and reviewd by a community of professional developers around the world.

The project is hosted on Netlify @ https://chima-dayo-pelumi-israel.netlify.app/
